## Project Details & Instructions

  For this project we were tasked with creating a PHP backend with at least one model and full CRUD functionality and pair it with a React frontend that renders the PHP backend.

  While in line to get a flu shot, I was struck with the idea to create an application that would allow you to submit and track health related events - doctor's visits, injuries, clinic visits, etc.

## The Challenges

  This project's turn around time was one of the challenges - 4 days. Another was working in a group. We decided to first produce an application that had full functionality then add additional features. We worked very productively heading tasks suited towards our skill sets.


## Areas of Improvement
  Two areas where we would have liked to improve the project were including authorization and continuing stylizing.

  For authorization, we attempted including it in the project, but we are not familiar with the Create React App and felt limited by using only the React framework.

  As for the styling, we opted to not use a CSS framework which offered endless possibilities for customization, but we did neglect to include media queries. If we had more time, including them would have been next on the to do list.

  One other wish-list item would have been to add more functionality like a checkbox to signal if the event was completed (for future events).
